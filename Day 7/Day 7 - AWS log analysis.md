The Peculiar Case of Care4Waresâ€™ Dry Funds
	A nonprofit organization hosted a fundraiser to raise money for gifts.
	 They promoted the event with a digital flyer hosted via S3. 
	 After the second day of sharing the flyer, they realized no more donations were received. 
	Donor shows proof of transaction made 3 days after link was sent and the account number on the flyer is incorrect. 
	The link hasn't been altered which suggests someone may have accessed the s3 bucket and modified the flyer. 

CloudWatch
	Monitoring of system and application metrics + configuration of alarms for each metric. 
	Aggregated logs (e.g., Route 53, CloudTrail)
	An agent must be installed on an EC2 instance for the metrics to be captured.
