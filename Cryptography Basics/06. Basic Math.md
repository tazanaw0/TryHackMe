Cryptography requires mathematical operations 
Two commonly used: 
	XOR operation 
		Exclusive OR
			Compares bits and outputs true (1) if the bits are different and false (0) if they have the same value
			
	XOR's truth table

| A   | B   | A ^ B |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     |
e.g., comparing 1101 and 1011 results in 0110 

| A   | B   | A^B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
Modulo Operation 
	The remainder when x is divided by y 
	written as % or mod
	not reversible + always returns non-negative number less than divisor (i.e., a%n the result woill always be in the following range 0 to n-1)
