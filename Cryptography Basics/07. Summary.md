In this room, we took a look at the importance of cryptography in ensuring secure communications over the internet. THM provided us with some fundamentals and included examples of their use in our daily lives. We also took a look at traditional cipher algorithms, standard block cipher algorithms, and the underlying math processes for public key cryptography.
