Symmetric (a.k.a. private key cryptography)
	Single key for encryption/decryption 
	Types of block cipher algorithms 
		Date Encryption Standard (DES)
			Introduce by NIST in 1977
				First crypto algo to go public 
				Broken in 1999, catalyst for 3DES
			64-bit plaintext
			56-bit key (8 bits for parity check)	
		Triple DES (3DES)
			Encrypt w/ DES 3 times 
			64-bit plaintext
			168-bit Key (112-bit most common)
			Deprecated in 2019 (may exist in some legacy systems)
		Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
			Adopted in 2001 
			128-bit plaintext 
			128, 192, 256-bit key size options 
	Often requires asymmetric cryptography to share keys 
		e.g., TCP/IP uses SSL/TLS to secure browser communication.  Browser establishes connection w/ TCP handshake, then completes an SSL/TLS handshake to determine the sessions cipher suite and validate the server's digital cert. The server chooses a cipher suite and sends their cert for validation.  Lastly, the client exchanges a premaster secret that'll allow both to compute the same symmetric key & MAC keys and establishes the start of end-to-end encryption.

Asymmetric (a.k.a. public key crpytography)
	Two keys or key pair, one for encryption (public key) and the other for decryption (private key)
	Types of algorithms 
		Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) (2048-bit (recommended min), 3072-bit, 4096-bit keys)
		Diffie-Hellman (same as RSA)
		Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (between 241 and 521-bit key sizes)
			256-bit ECC key can accomplish the same security as the use of a 3072-bit RSA key. 
			Efficient asymmetric algo
				best for devices with little store or processing power (IoT devices, e.g, smartwatch)
				+ used by BTC & ETH for digital signatures + key gen
	Requires more time/compute than symmetric
		Larger key sizes
