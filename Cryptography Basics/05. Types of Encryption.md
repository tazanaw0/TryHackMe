Symmetric 
	Single key for encryption/decryption
	Often requires asymmetric cryptography to share keys (e.g., browser uses asymmetric to establish connection (handshake, share symmetric key), then uses symmetric to encrypt data) 

Asymmetric
	Two keys or key pair, one for encryption and the other for decryption
	Requires more time/compute than symmetric
