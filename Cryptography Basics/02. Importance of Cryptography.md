Cryptography is used in our every day lives even though we may not directly interact with the process. For example, when a user logs on to a website, TLS encrypts all the data within the session. Another example is when a user wishes to access a remote file server (SFTP). The user's system and the remote server establish a secure tunnel that provides end-to-end encryption preventing unauthorized parties from listening or interfering.
