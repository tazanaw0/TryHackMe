To begin, I repeated the booting process from the last task. 
Working w/ Directories
	make directory (mkdir)
		create a directory or folder using the following syntax:
			mkdir exampleDir
	remove directory (rmdir)
		delete any director using the following syntax: 
			rmdir exampleDir
	change directory (cd)
		navigate to directories or folders within your file system with the following syntax:
			cd exampleDir
		without parameters tells you which storage drive you're using and the path or directory 
	directory (dir)
		displays child directories, similar to linux ls command
		append /a to display hidden and system files 
		append /s to display all files in the current directory and all subdirectories
	tree
		used to display the structure of your filesystem. 

Working w/ Files
	Type
		outputs contents of a file into the terminal, similar to linux cat command
	more 
		presents files in a page by page format, where we can use the space bar to move between pages or enter to move between each line.  
	copy 
		copy files to another location, syntax same as using 'cp' in linux 
	move 
		move files to another location, syntax same as using 'mv' in linux 
	del || erase 
		deletes any file you specify as a parameter 
	* Wildcard 
		* used to reference multiple files with a common extension. 
		e.g., 
		move * .txt Documents - moves all txt files from current dir to Docs

			Another example where I created several text files in the command line and used a wildcard to display all text files in the current dir.
