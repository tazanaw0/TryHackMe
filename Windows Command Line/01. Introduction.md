Benefits of CLI over GUI 
	Lower resource usage - useful for systems with limited memory and saving money in the cloud 
	Automation - create scripts to execute tasks. 
	Remote management - conveniently access and manage remote systems using ssh. More reliable than RDP when there are slow network speeds and systems with limited resources 

Learning Objectives:
	We'll learn how to use the command line to: 
		Display basic system information 
		Check and troubleshoot network configuration 
		Manage files and folders
		Check running processes 

Establishing an SSH connection 
	In order to practice, we'll have to connect via ssh to a Windows VM from THM's AttackBox.
	To establish the connection, we loaded up the terminal in the AttackBox and entered the following cmd
		ssh 'username'@'machinesIPAddress' 
		allowed trust by answering 'yes' when prompted 
		entered password
	We successfully authenticated with the remote machine as confirmed by the name change in terminal.
