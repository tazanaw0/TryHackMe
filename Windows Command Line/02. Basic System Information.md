Windows commands can only be written within your Windows Path. 
We can use the 'set' command to check our path
	Set shows us where Windows will execute commands 
'Ver' displays information on the version of our OS 
'systeminfo' lists information about core components of our system (OS info, processor, memory etc.)

	Here's an example of output after running 'systeminfo' 
	We noticed THM is using AWS to administer lab machines, the installation date of the machine's OS, and more. 

Whenever output is too long we can pipe a command through more
	more displays output page by page
	navigate to the next page using spacebar and exit with ctrl + c
	e.g., driveryquery | more or systeminfo | more
	Redirecting the first portion of each command to 'more' allows for information to be displayed in a more organized fashion.

	I ran 'ver' for the first question and ran 'systeminfo' for the second. Initially, I tried to use the version info from the 'systeminfo' output for the first question but I kept getting it incorrect. Then, I remembered to use 'ver' and it provided me with more numbers which is what the question expected.
