By going through each task, I've learned how to use the command line to complete tasks I'd typically use a gui for. For example 'ver' command allows us to efficiently obtain information on our systems current OS. 
Additionally, we can use commands like netstat and tracert for detailed information about active connections and data traversing the internet. Then, I learned how to navigate through the file system using commands like cd, mkdir, rmdir, and move. 
Finally, I learned how to lists and terminate tasks using tasklist and taskkill. 

THM left out a few commands they deemed not friendly for beginners. 
	chkdisk
		checks file system and disk volumes for errors and bad sectors 
	driverquery
		displays device drivers
	sfc /scannow
		scans system files for corruption and repairs them when possible
