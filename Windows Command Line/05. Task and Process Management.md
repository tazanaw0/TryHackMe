```
tasklist
	lists running processes 
```
use filters to reduce output 
	tasklist /? to view available options
e.g., 
	tasklist /FI "imagename eq sshd.exe"
	/FI tells the cmd line to set the filter image name equal (eq) to sshd.exe 

```
taskkill
	terminates tasks 
```
Once we identify a PID, to terminate a task we can use
	taskkill /PID exampleTargetPID
e.g., taskkill /PID 1214

	Here I ran both commands for practice. Unfortunately, taskkill couldn't identify the PID and since the majority of tasks are crucial to the environment I decided to leave it alone.
