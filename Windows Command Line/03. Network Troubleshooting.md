Prior to interacting with the room, I booted up Kali and connected to THM's openvpn server. Then, I successfully authenticated with ssh and now, I'm ready to dive in!

Network Configuration 
	 ipconfig command used to gather details about a systems current network configurations. 
	 output:
		 Ip address 
		 subnet mask 
		 default gateway 
	when /all flag appended to the end:
		mac address
		dns address
		dhcp address & status 
		+ more 

Network Troubleshooting 
	Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) used to communicate error messages between network devices. 
	In particular, the ping command is used to send packets over ICMP and determines if a connection can be established by waiting for the targets response. 
		e.g., ping -c 3 google.com
	Trace route (tracert) 
	tracert provides more details about the communication process. It presents the status of packets reaching each node while it traverses the network to its intended destination. 
	It expects each node to notify us if a packet has been dropped along its route  p) 
		returns an ip address of a host or domain + can return the fqdn of an ip address.
	we can append a dns server address if we wish to use a specific name server.
		nslookup example.com 1.1.1.1 
	netstat 
		displays current network configurations and listening ports 
		e.g., in our attack box netstat outputs a socket with 22 at the end because we have an established connection with a windows machine over ssh. 
		-h option displays help page 
		-a displays all established connections and listening ports
		-b shows programs associated with each connection/port
		-o reveals the process ID (PID) for each connection 
		-n uses numerical form for addresses and port numbers
