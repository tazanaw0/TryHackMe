# TryHackMe
Hello! I’m Teme, a cybersecurity student working towards becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst by combining my degree with hands-on experience in home labs. I know that developing my skill set and standing out in the industry will take time, patience, and grit.

I recently found TryHackMe, an educational platform offering practical, hands-on exercises across a wide range of cybersecurity topics. I’m starting with their Intro to Offensive Security path, which focuses on foundational offensive techniques.

This repository documents my learning journey through various labs on TryHackMe. Follow along to see my progress, challenges, and insights as I build my cybersecurity skills!
