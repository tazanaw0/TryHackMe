Previously, we looked at OUs and how they're used to group AD objects together. Now, we'll look at implementing Group Policy Objects (GPOs). 
GPOs are a collection of settings that can be applied to any OU. 
	we can create a baseline for users and computers
They're configured through the Group Policy Management snap-in. (gpmc.msc)
	Create the GPO under "GP Objects"
	Link GPO to OU
		Any GPO will apply to its linked OU and any child OUs. 
Inside of a GPO: 
	Scope
		Info on which OUs are linked
		Security Filtering 
			Apply GPO to specific users and computers within an OU
			**default authenticated users group, i.e., gpo will apply to all ad objects w/ an account (user/machines**
	Details
		Info on the GPO itself
			data created, date last modified, status..
	Settings 
		Info on the policies configured 
			under security settings we can see account policies
			there's a 42 day maximum pwd age and they've enabled a setting requiring passwords to meet complexity requirements. 
Task 1: 
We're tasked with editing the 'Default Domain Policy' and changing the minimum length requirement for passwords from 7 to 10. 
	Navigated to the GPO, right-clicked and selected edit. 
The pwd policy settings are under the following path: 
	Computer Configurations -> Policies -> Windows Setting -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy
**Double click on any policy for an explanation**
GPO Distribution 
	GPOs distributed to AD network via network share 'SYSVOL'
	By default, the share points to:
		C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\ on each DC
	+ Changes can take up to 2 hours for machines to recognize them. 
		+ 'gpupdate /force' command can force machines to sync with SYSVOL 
Task 2: 
Creating some GPOs for THM Inc. 
	1. Configure GPO to block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel and System Settings. 
		1. create GPO 
		2. search for policy under 'user config,' since we're targeting non-IT **users**
		3. User Configurations -> Admin Temp -> Control Panel 
		4. Enable 'Prohibit access...'
		5. navigate to gpmc, drag GPO to each non-IT OU. 
	2. Make machines auto lock their screen after 5 minutes of inactivity. 
		1. Create GPO
		2. search for policy under 'computer config' 
		3. security settings -> local policies-> security options
		4.Set 'Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit' to 300 seconds. 
		5. navigate to gpmc, drag GPO to root domain (THM.local)
Task 3: 
	Logon as AD user Mark and verify configurations.
