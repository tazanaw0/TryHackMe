Data stored as objects 
	Users, groups, computers, printers, shares, etc. 
Users 
	security principals
		authenticated by domain + can be assigned certain privileges to domain resources 
	Two entities:
		People
			anyone in org that needs to access network (e.g., staff, students)
		Services 
			services utilized by org defined as users, where the service 'user' only has rights to components required for it to run. 
Machines
	Computers joined as machine objects
	security principals 
		each computer assigned an account 
		pwds are auto rotated out + 120 random chars
	Standard (specific) naming scheme (e.g., Client01, (machine account) Client01)
Security Groups 
	Security Principals 
	Assign privileges to roles or groups of users
		Users, machines, and other groups (group w/ in. a group)
	Groups created by default 
		Domain Admins

AD Users and Computers (ADUC)
	App for configuring users, machines and groups 
OU's 
	Container for users/machines 
	User can only be a part of a single OU at a time, but can be in one-to-many groups 
	Mimic business structure 
		e.g., 
		FSU, Parent OU
			IT, Child OU
			HR, Child OU
			Students, Child OU....
	Efficiently deploy baseline policies to departments

Default OU's 
Builtin
	Default groups available to any Windows host (server operator, admin, account operator, etc. )
Computers
	Machines joining domain are placed here by default
Domain Controllers
	Contains DCs in your ADDS network. 
Users
	Default users and groups (domain-wide) e.g., guest, admin
Managed Service Accounts 
	Stores accounts used by services 

Security Groups vs OUs
	OUs
		Apply policies (e.g., Students internet access confined by external DNS filter or restrict access to settings and control panel)
	Groups 
		Grant permissions over resources (e.g., Students can access printers in the library and xyz building)
