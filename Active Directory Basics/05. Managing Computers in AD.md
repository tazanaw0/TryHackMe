From there, we can select computer accounts and move them into different OUs 

Typically 3 categories: 
	Workstations
		everyday use 
		no privileged user access 
	Servers
		provide services to users and other servers
	DCs
		Manage AD domain 
		Highly sensitive as they store hashed pwds for every user account
