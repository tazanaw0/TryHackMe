In this room, we learned about the basics of Window's Active Directory. It discussed how components of an AD environment are stored as objects and how we can use snap-ins to manage objects. For example, we can use users and computers to configure and manage user account. There was hands-on experience when looking into Group Policy where we got to create GPOs and link them to an OU. We looked at authentication protocols and how Windows uses tickets, hashing, and encryption for authentication. Lastly, we learned about trees, forests and trust. Trees allow subdomains to be joined together under one root domain, forests allow us to integrate multiple domains under one large network, and trust determines access between domains.
