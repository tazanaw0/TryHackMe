Trees 
	join multiple domains into one large network 
	e.g., company Y expands into other countries where data privacy laws are different. Y can build a tree with their root domain y.org and create a subdomain for each new country. 
	y.org -> CA.y.org![Tree](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/abea24b7979676a1dcc0c568054544c8.png)
		Domain admins can assign permissions and rights locally (w/ in domain) or globally, where members can access objects in other domains. 
	'Enterprise Admins' 
		Security group that grants a user admin privileges over every domain. 
Forests
	Integrates several trees into one network
	Best when working with different domains under one organization. 
	e.g., Y company acquires flame.org and adds a tree for flame into their network. ![Forest](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/03448c2faf976db890118d835000bab7.png)


Trust Relationships
	Determine permissions and access to resources within an AD environment (e.g., tree -> tree)
	One-way trust
		Trust limited to one entity i.e., if Domain A trusts Domain B, then Domain B can access A but A cannot access B
	Two-way trust
		Mutual trust 
		By default, joining domains under a forest or tree forms a two-way trust relationship
	Trust relationships do not auto grant access to every resource
	Once trust is established, the DC admin determines who's authorized.
