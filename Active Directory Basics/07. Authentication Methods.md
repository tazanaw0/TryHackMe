AD domain credentials stored in DCs
Users authenticate w/ DC to access services (workstation, email, etc.)

Two authentication protocols (WIN):
	Kerberos 
		Default in any recent version of Windows
		Authenticated users are assigned tickets (proof of prev. authentication)
		 Tickets used to grant users access to services they've authenticated w/ in the past. 
	NetNTLM
		Legacy, kept for compatibility purposes - domains running on older servers

Kerberos auth process: 
	1. User sends their username and an encrypted timestamp (key derived from password) to the Key Distribution Center (KDC, installed on DC & and manages tickets)
	1. KDC creates and responds back w/ a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT, allows user to request more tickets without entering credentials for each service)
		TGT encrypted w/ krbtgt hash, so user cant access
	+ Session key is generated and passed to user (encrypted w/ user hash)![Kerberos step 1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/d36f5a024c20fb480cdae8cd09ddc09f.png)
	2. User uses TGT to request a Ticket Granting Service (TGS, only allows connection to specific services)
	2. User sends username, timestamp (encrypted w/ session key), TGT and a Service Principle Name (SPN, service and server name)
	3. KDC responds with TGS and a Service Session Key
		+ TGS encrypted using key derived from the Service Owner's (service's user/machine account) hash. 
		+ TGS contains copy of Service Session key so that Service Owner can access by decrypting it. ![Kerberos step 2](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/84504666e78373c613d3e05d176282dc.png)
	4. User receives response and uses TGS to authenticate and connect w/ service. 
		+ Service uses its account pwd hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session Key. ![Kerberos step 3](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/8fbf08d03459c1b792f3b6efa4d7f285.png)
NetNTLM Authentication 
	Challenge-response method 
	1. Client sends auth request to server 
	2. Server generates random number (sent as challenge)
	3. Client responds by combining their NTLM password hash w/ challenge (+ any other data) (Client verifies w/ server)
	4. Server forwards challenge + response to DC for verification (Server verifies w/ DC)
	5. DC uses challenge to recalculate the Client's response and compares it (similar to dig signature when comparing hashes)
		1. response match = authenticated. else, denied. 
	6. Server forwards DC's response to client. ![NetNTLM authentication](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/2eab5cacbd0d3e9dc9afb86169b711ec.png)

++ Security Account Manager (SAM)
	Windows Database housing user account credentials (usernames + hashed pwds)
	managed by Local Security Authority (LSA)
	and validates users by cross-referencing pwds within SAM Database.
