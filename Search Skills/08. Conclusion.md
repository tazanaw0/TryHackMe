This room provided us with information on threat hunting, validating search results, locating technical documentation, vulnerabilities, and exploits. I learned about browsers tailored for identifying devices and services over the internet, Google Dorking,  web applications that scan files for viruses, CVEs and more. We can use tools like Shodan and Censys to enhance the threat hunting processes. Additionally, we can use VirusTotal to identify malware embedded with any file or folder.
