Broken Access Control 
	Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.
		Â internal object identifiers, such as database keys or file paths
e.g., user A only has permissions to acccess img04.jpg
	they think there must be other images since the file are numbered, so they try to access img01-03 and succeed although they don't have permission (IDOR)
