McSkidy and Glitch want to hire an eDiscovery company to process some forensic data for their investigation. They have invited bids from third parties for this purpose. Three companies have bid for the project. McSkidy and Glitch now need to do a risk assessment on all three of these companies to identify the one with the least amount of risk so that they can move forward. All three companies were ==required to fill out a questionnaire based on which a risk assessment will be done.==
GRC
	 understanding external security standards, translating them into internal standards, and then ensuring that they are applied by all parties' to help reduce the organization's risk to an acceptable level.
	 Governance 
		 Security practices, strategies, policies, and standards
		 + Defines roles and responsibilities 
	Risk
		identify, assess, quantify, and mitigate
		Based on findings, make necessary adjustments to achieve an acceptable level of risk. 
	Compliance 
		Ensuring that an org or entity adheres to all external legal, regulator, and industry standards. (e.g., GDPR, HIPPA, SOX, ISO 27001)		
Performing a Risk Assessment 
	Completing a risk register (register tracks progress of mitigation and all open risk)
	e.g., 
		![[Pasted image 20250204161006.png]]
		+ examples of identified risks: high-privileged user account without proper security controls, third-party vendor who might be infected by a malware connecting to the organization's network, system for which support has ended by the vendor and it is still in production.
		+ Assigning Likelihood (qualitative) 
			+Scale differs by org and frameworks used, but 1-5 is commonly used where 5 denotes a risk that's most likely to occur and 1 denotes a risks that's improbably or unlikely to occur. 
			***Materialization of a risk*** is when an identified risk becomes a problem. 
		+ Assigning Impact to Each risk (qualitative)
			+Similar to likelihood, the scale for impact varies. (e.g., some may use CVSS and others may use their own rating based on the CIA of an asset)
			Additionally, the scale is often from 1-5 where 1 denotes very low impact (informational) and 5 denotes the most dangerous threat (critical). 
		+Risk ownership 
			Once risks are identified, we can compute a risk score by multiplying the likelihood and impact or we can use DREAD and other rating systems. 
				Prioritize risks based on their score!
			+ Accept risks based on the costs if it were to become realized. If it costs less to leave the risk open, mitigation may not be required. 
Internal and Third-Party Risk Assessments 
	Why Internal?
		Understand orgs security posture 
			Identify weak spots, direct resources to most important areas, maintain compliance w/ rules and regulations!
	Why Third -Party?
		Ensure vendors are compliant w/ the orgs standards and industry standards, and regulations. +++ REDUCES Supply Chain risk

Procuring a partner
	Task: 
		You will have to assess the level of risk that each of the vendors pose. We sent a questionnaire to each potential third-party and have received their answers. Using these answers, you will have to add new risks to the risk register, which will give an overall risk score for each third-party. Once done, we can choose the third-party that has the lowest risk score.
