Routers use routing to connect and pass data between WANs.
	Often feature console/web interface allowing owner to configure port forwarding, firewalls and other security features. 
Routing 
	Determines optimal path for packets in-transit
		OSPF (state info, copper or fiber, PreSec 3.4)
		RIP (least number of hops, PreSec 3.4)
Switches connect multiple devices within a LAN and passed data between them 
	default gateway for devices within a subnet
	Layer 2 forwards frames based on MAC addresses
		VLANs limited to comms within their own subnet
		Add router for inter-VLAN routing
	Layer 3 forwards frames based via MAC and packets via IP routing
		Handles inter-VLAN routing
			Ideal if we want VLANs to comm with each other. 
Frames within subnet and packets between VLANs

	VLAN 2 -> VLAN 1 (packets)
	VLAN 2 -> VLAN 2 (frames)
