Presents user with required actions to create shadow copies (snapshots).
VS Copies are stored on the System Volume Info folder on each drive that has protection enabled. 
If VSS enabled (Sys Protection on), we can do the following: 
	Create a restore point
	Perform system restore
	Configure restore settings
	Delete restore points 

attackers are aware of shadow copies and often write code to search and delete all shadow copies making it impossible to recover from a ransomware attack (unless you have offline/off-site backup)
Configure by right clicking storage media (sys protection must be on) and select 'Configure Shadow Copies'
