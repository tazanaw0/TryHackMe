Processing Data Units == Packets
IPv4, IPv6 addresses 
	Determines the where. 
Routing - Determines path for packets to reach destination
Optimal paths accomplished via:
	Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) - State info 
		Calculates shortest path using current state of all nodes or links and available bandwidth 
			any nodes with dropped packets? fiber vs copper? 
	&&
	Routing Information Protocol (RIP) - Hops 
		Path based on hops (nodes) required to reach destination. 
Re-assembly of packets (tcp) 
UDP packets sent as-is and aren't fragmented
