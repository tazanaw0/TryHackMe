Top-Level Domain (TLD)
	Last portion of a domain name

		cannot start/end with hyphen or have consecutive hyphens
		e.g., Amazon.com 
		Amazon = Second-Level Domain

	First portion of a domain name, on the lefthand side of the second-level domain 
		Length requirement exact as Second-Level req.
		Can create multiple subdomains for a single domain
		e.g., staff.servers.tazlab.local
