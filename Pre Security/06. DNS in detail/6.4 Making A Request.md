	1. Checks local cache
	2. Recursive server cache (ISP provided) 
	If client request not in (1 or 2) cache, query root DNS server: 
	3. Directs request to TLD server
		1. e.g., frostburg.edu , root server will direct you to TLD server that deals with .edu addresses and gives the request info on the authoritative name server
	4. TLD server directs request to authoritative name server (unique to each domain) 
	5. Authoritative server replies to the recursive server (saves it to cache, depending on record type) and then forwards the response back to the client. 
		DNS records come w/ TTL i.e., they'll auto-delete from cache
