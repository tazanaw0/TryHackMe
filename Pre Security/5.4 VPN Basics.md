Virtual private tunnel for different networks to communicate 
Encryption - Mitigates eavesdropping or packet sniffing (IPSEC, OpenVPN, etc.)
Offers anonymity - Prevents ISPs from viewing content of user communications.
	ISP can view the VPN's IP address, session duration, amount of data transferred (upload/download), but can't make any sense of data traversing the tunnel.

| Point-to-Point                           | Authentication and encryption through private key and public certificate - Private key and cert are non-routable. i.e., doesn't get shared across the internet, so decryption only possible by private key owner                                                    |
| Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) | Allows data from PPP to travel and leave a network by encapsulating PPP frames into IP packets - Easy setup, weakly encrypted relative to alternatives like OpenVPN, IPSEC, etc.                                                                                    |
| Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)       | Encrypts IP packets and encapsulates/ them with (ESP or AH) headers, then packets are routed to a VPN concentrator for takeoff. Destination concentrator decrypts the IPSec headers & payloads (decapsulating them) and then forwards original packets to receiver. |
