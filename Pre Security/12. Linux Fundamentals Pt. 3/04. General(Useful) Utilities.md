Serving Files from Host - WEB
	Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with Python3
	Python3 module HTTPServer allows user to serve files from their computer (computer becomes web server)
		thus, anyone on the internet can get files using wget or curl
	HTTPServer serves files in the dir where we run the http.server command 
		e.g., home/resumeSite python3 -m http.server
			host machine serves files from resumeSite dir for any user to access over HTTP
			once started, HTTPServer wont end until we stop the server
