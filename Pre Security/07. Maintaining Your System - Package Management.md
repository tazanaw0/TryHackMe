Managing Repositories (add/remove)
	apt (to install)
	benefits of using apt vs dpkg, whenever we update our system, the repository for software installed w/ apt gets checked for updates. 
	Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) keys used for integrity and authentication (think dig signature), 
		systems check keys for match
	e.g., downloading sublime
		download gpg key using wget
			wget http://www....
		use apt-key to trust gpg key
			apt-key add (key)
		add sublime repository to apt source list
			/etc/apt/sources.list.d 
			touch sublime-text.list (each repository has its own file)
		use nano to add and sublime repository text into sublime-text.list file
		run apt update so apt recognizes the new repository entry
		apt install sublime-text to install
	Removing packages
	`add-apt-repository --remove ppa:PPA_Name/ppa`Â command
	or manually deleting the source list file 
	then,
	apt remove sublime-text
