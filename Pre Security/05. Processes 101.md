Processes managed by kernel 
Each process has its own unique identifier 
	Process ID (PID)
	Assigned in sequential order (e.g., (echo "hi guys")120 -> (echo "hey")121)
	starts @ 0 (when you first boot in linux, systemd is the first process recognized in ps) 
	systemd
		 sits between OS and user and controls each process (child processes, run on their own but managed by systemd)
	systemctl allows us to interact w. systemd process/daemon 
		syntax systemctl option service 
			four options: start, stop, enable, disable 
		e.g., systemctl start apache2
			start apache2 server. 
View processes w/ ps cmd
	ps
		outputs status (code), cpu usage time, etc.
	ps aux
		outputs processes ran by all users on machine 
	top 
		real time statistics on processes running that refresh every 10 seconds or when you scroll up to view previous entries. 

Managing processes | Terminate processes w/ commands 
	kill associatedPID 
		e.g., kill 128 (firefox window) force quits the app
	additionally
		- SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
		- SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
		- SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process

How do Processes Start?
	Namespaces
		Segment portions of compute resources 
		Each portion has access to resources within namespace & can only comm view processes within namespace

Getting Processes/Services to Start on Boot
	Web servers, DB servers, file transfer servers often configured to start during boot-up 
		systemctl to configure start up on boot

Intro to Backgrounding and Foregrounding 
	Processes can run in two states
		Backgrounding 
			e.g., firewall
			'&' after a command to run the process in background 
			or 
			ctrl + z
				pauses execution of script/cmd 
				e.g., disabling web server logs
		Foregrounding (Occur in our view)
			resuming a process that we've stopped temporarily 
			fg
				brings the background process back into terminal 
					e.g., displays web server logs
