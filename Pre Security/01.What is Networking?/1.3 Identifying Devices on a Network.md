Two means of identification: 
	IP address
		(WAN) Public - Derived from private IP using NAT and assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
		(LAN) Private - Used to communicate within a local area network. 
		IPv4 32-bit IP addresses || 4.29 Billion
			e.g. 10.0.0.1 (4 octets, 8 bits each)
		IPv6 128-bit IP addresses || 340 trillion +  
			e.g. 2a00:22c4:a532:c500:d1cc:6aae:abb0:8dda (8 octets, 16 bits each) - Hexadecimal chars only. (0-9, a-f) 
	Media Access Control (MAC) Address
		Physical network interface attached to a devices motherboard with an assigned, unique address. 
		12 character hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon
			First half of chars specific to a manufacturer and the latter is the unique portion)
			e.g. a4:c3:f0:e3:9d:bd  a4:c3:f0 = intel e3:9d:bd = unique address 
			Places of business that offer free public wifi can use MAC address control to provide better performing wifi if the customer is willing to pay. 
The same private IP cannot run simultaneously on different devices within the same network. 
	E.g. With our home lab, we cannot assign the same static IP to two different client machines.

	We were unable to access the internet from Bob's device because he didn't pay for the hotel's wifi service, so we spoofed his IP with Alice's IP and successfully sent a request to the internet.
