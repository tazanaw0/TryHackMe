Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets used to determine the performance of a connection between devices. 
	Does the connection exist? (x amount of packets received, if 0 we know there's no connection)
	Is it reliable? (Time= x, and x% packet loss, used to identify performance)
		Echo request (ping x.x.x.x || xyz.com) & echo reply (xx bytes from x.x.x.x icmp_seq=x ttl = xx time=x.x ms)
		ttl = time to live is the period of time a system stores icmp packets before discarding. 
		Final responses 'time' = ping
