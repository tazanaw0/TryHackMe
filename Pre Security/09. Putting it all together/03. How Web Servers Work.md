Web server is a software that listens for incoming connections and then utilizes the HTTP protocol (methods, status codes) to deliver web content to its clients
The most common web server software are
	Apache, Nginx, IIS and NodeJS
Web servers stores files in its own root directory. 

Virtual hosts | Allow web servers to host multiple (unlimited) websites on the same server. (Text-based config file)
	The web server software checks the hostname being requested from the HTTP headers and matches that against its virtual hosts. If there's a match, it'll GET the files from that site's directory (in most cases, they'll have their own directory), and if not the default website is presented. 

Static vs Dynamic 
	Static: Content served from web server as-is and doesn't change when delivered. 
	Dynamic: Content served from web server that can be changed with different requests. 
		Example: Search function in Gmail where the results displayed depend on our entry.
