Load balancer algorithms: 
	**round-robin**, which sends it to each server in turn
	**weighted**, which checks how many requests a server is currently dealing with and sends it to the least busy server.
LB's perform health checks to ensure each server is running correctly. 

Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
	Allows high traffic websites to host files on many different servers throughout the world. Whenever users request one of the files, the CDN uses a server closest to the user to deliver it. 
	+ they reduce web server workloads and enhances performance. 

Web Application Firewall (WAF)
	sits between your web request and the web server
	It analyses the web requests for common attack techniques, whether the request is from a real browser rather than a bot. 
	rate limiting 
		 if an excessive amount of web requests are being sent rate limiting will only allow x number of requests from an IP per second. 
		 If deemed a potential attack, it will be dropped and never reaches web server.
