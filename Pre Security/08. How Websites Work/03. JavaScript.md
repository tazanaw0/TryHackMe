Introduces interactive elements to a webpage
JavaScript is added within the page's source code and can be either loaded within `<script>` tags or included remotely with the src attribute: `<script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>`
Here the JavaScript code finds a HTML element on the page with the id of "demo" and changes the element's contents to "Hack the Planet" : `document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";`
JavaScript events is code that executes when the user interacts with a website. 
Here the onclick event is used to change the button element from 'Click Me!' to 'Button Clicked,' once a user clicks the button. 
`<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>Click Me!</button>` 
Events can also be defined inside the JavaScript script tags 
	preferred over inline event handlers
