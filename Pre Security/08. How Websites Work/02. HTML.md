HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language websites are written in. 
Elements (or tags) tell the browser how to display content. 
Every HTML document begins with the following tags: 
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardization across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
- `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML page - all other elements come after this element.
- `<head>` element contains information about the page (e.g., page title)
- `<body>` element defines the HTML document's body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser.
+++ Many other tags specific to certain types of content
Attributes: elements can have multiple attributes.
	Class: often used to group elements
	ID: often used to style individual elements
src attribute is used to specify the location of a file 
	(e.g., img src="photos/ex.jpg")
