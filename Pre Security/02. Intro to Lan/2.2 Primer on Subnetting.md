Subnetting 
	Dividing a network into two or more mini networks using available host id's
		Efficiency
		Full Control 
		Security
	Subnet mask used to identify network and host id's 
	IP's used in 4 different ways: E.g., 192.168.44.0/24 (<> = example)
		Network ID - Unique IP of subnet range <> 192.168.44.0
		Host address || host address range - Available IP's for host machines <>192.168.44.2-192.168.44.254
		Default gateway - Used to send data outside of the subnet range
			Typically network + 1 ip || last host address. <> 192.66.44.1 || 192.66.44.254
		Broadcast address - Used for relaying communication within a LAN. 
			Typically last address <> 192.168.44.255
E.g., 
	Local cafe with two networks: 
	1. One for employees, cash registers, and other devices for the facility
	2. One for the general public to use as a hotspot
