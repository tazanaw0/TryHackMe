Star topology 
	Central hub 
	Point-to-point link from each node to hub
	Easily install, manage and scale 
	Single point of failure and costly (dependent on number of nodes)
Bus topology
	Backbone cable 
	Data traverses from each node on the same backbone 
	Simultaneous requests may cause performance bottleneck 
		Difficult troubleshooting (root cause), especially if many nodes are active. 
	Cost efficient and easy to install 
	Single point of failure and nodes must wait for outbound traffic to reach its destination in order to receive inbound traffic 
Ring Topology a.k.a. token 
	Loop of connected devices 
	Sends data from one node to another until it reaches its destination
		NodeC waits to forward data from NodeB if NodeC has an active outbound request 
	Easy to troubleshoot, add nodes
	Poor latency and single point of failure 
What is a switch? 
	Network device used to aggregate devices within a network using ethernet. 
	Devices connect via ethernet to ports on switch
		# of ports range from 4-64 
	Maintains state info of devices connected (associates port # w/ device)
		Enables better latency as devices can directly reach their intended destination. 
	Switches and Routers often connected to one another

	Increases redundancy (adding multiple paths)
		No downtime (internal and external queries) -> If one link fails, try another. If one switch fails, try another. 
What is a router? 
	Connects networks and passes data to destination using IP address (Routing via IP and paths available)
