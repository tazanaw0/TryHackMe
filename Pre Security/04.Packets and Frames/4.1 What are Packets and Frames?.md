Encapsulation/Decapsulation | Envelope within an envelope 
	Packet encapsulated into frame by adding frame-specific header and trailers. (Outbound)
	Packet becomes frame's payload. 
	Frame decapsulated by removing frame-specific headers and trailers. (Inbound)
		Reveals packets for network layer to process 
So, 
	(Inbound)
		Synchronization of bits for processing at data-link layer
		Bits converted into frames and frames decapsulated for processing at network layer. 
		Network Layer receives packet & removes IP header, then passes to transport layer. 
		Transport layer receives segment and removes TCP/UDP header, leaving the payload 
		Payload processed at the presentation layer ==(if applicable) for formatting, encryption, or compression.==
		Then, payload presented to the application 
	(Outbound)
		Application layer sends payload to presentation layer 
		If applicable, perform formatting, compression, and encryption.
		Session layer establishes session if necessary, then passes payload to transport layer 
			Not all protocols depend on session layer, e.g., HTTP traffic (stateless) 
				HTTPS, FTP, SSH, IPSEC, etc. require sessions 
		Transport layer processes payload as segments
			adding TCP or UDP header (port #'s, seq #'s, flags (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, FIN)
		Segments passed to network layer, where they are encapsulated into packets. 
			adding IP header and trailer to specify source and destination IP + trailer for integrity check (checksum, etc.) 
		Packets sent to data-link layer, where they are encapsulated into frames.
			adding Frame header that identify source and destination mac address and trailer for error checking (cyclic redundancy check, etc.)
		Frames passed to physical layer where it's converted into a stream of bits and ready for transmission. 
Some packet headers and their description 

| Time to Live (TTL)  | Sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Checksum\|          | Integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP. If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt. |
| Source Address      | IP address of the device that the packet is being sent **from** so that data knows where to **return to**                                           |
| Destination Address | IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.<br>                                                                 |
