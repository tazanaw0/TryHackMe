![TCP/IP Packet Format - GeeksforGeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230624200917/TCP-packet-format.jpg)

SEQ Number - First packet is given a random number sequence and is reconstructed using this number sequence and incrementing by 1. Both computers must agree on the same number sequence for data to be sent in the correct order 
	1. SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Sequence Number(ISN) to SYNchronize with (0)
	2. SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Sequence Number (ISN) to SYNchronize with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)
	3. ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Sequence Number (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (0 + 1)
ACK Number - Reflects the next expected byte, incrementing by the length of the received payload.
	If the sender's sequence number is ==100 and they send 500 bytes of data==, the ==acknowledgment number will increment by 500, becoming 600==, indicating the ==receiver is ready for the next byte starting at 600.==

**FLAGS**

| SYN     | Initial packet sent by a client during the handshake. This packet is used to initiate a connection and synchronize the two devices together.                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SYN-ACK | Sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronization attempt from the client.                                                                                                                              |
| ACK     | Acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received                                                                                                                                                  |
| DATA    | Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message                                                                                                                          |
| FIN     | This packet is used to _cleanly (properly)_ close the connection after it has been complete. Because ==TCP reserves system resources on a device==, it is best practice to close TCP connections as soon as possible.          |
| RST     | Abruptly ends all communication. Last resort and ==indicates there was some problem during the process==. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. |
