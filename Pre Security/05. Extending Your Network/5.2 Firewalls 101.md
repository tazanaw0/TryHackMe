Sits at edge of network, acting as gatekeeper between WAN and LAN
Allow/Deny traffic into a network based on: 
	IP and Port (Who and where?)
	Application (What)
	TCP/UDP (How)
	Signatures (NGFW, What)
		Analyzes payload (Is there a match?)
	Content filtering (NGFW, What)

Stateful 
	Analyzes entire connection - Keeps track of state (it all matters)
	E.g., Client connects successfully, receives SYN-ACK, but as they send their first DATA packet, firewall blocks client. 
Stateless 
	Analyzes individual packets  - Previous session irrelevant 
		Static set of rules, do each packet comply? If not, bad packet blocked. 
		If no rule configured and client sends bad packet, GG. 
	Great for DDoS, though - E.g., Block packets from this IP and port #
