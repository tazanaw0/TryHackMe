Re-assembly of tcp packets 
	congestion control
		congestion window (cwnd)
			max size of data sent before receiving first ACK flag
	congestion avoidance 
		cwnd reset when packet loss detected - gauge network capacity  
	slow-start restart 
		cwnd reset for idle connections
	flow control 
		receive window (rwnd)
			max size of data allowed based on available buffer space. 
			updated for each ACK flag (How many can we ack right now?)
	error checking (retransmit packet if incorrect, missing or out of order)
		checksum 
		ACK flags
		Sequence numbers 
	TCP packets wait in receivers buffer expecting retransmission of missing segment. 
		If sender unable to retransmit, all buffered segments are dropped. 
	A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the other device the whole time.
UDP packets aren't fragmented & as-is (Higher layers determine flow of inbound traffic, retransmission and more, IF configured to do so)
	no message delivery guarantee
	no guarantee of sequence 
	no congestion control 
	no connection state tracking (NAT uses timer for UDP flow, keeps public ip/port >  local ip/port mapping for set amount of time) 
		keep alive packets (bidirectional)
			tells NAT to reset timer of UDP session
				'There's more packets to send, give us more time!'
