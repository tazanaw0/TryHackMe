Session begins once connection established 
Active until connection terminated 
	Session layer decides when to terminate based on idleness or lost connection. 
Can contain checkpoints 
	if data lost, only new data is required to be sent, saving bandwidth
Sessions are unique i.e., data from one session cannot be mixed into another session. 
	e.g., Each tab has its own separate session
