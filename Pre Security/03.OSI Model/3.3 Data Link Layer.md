Processing Data Units == frames
Physical addressing of traffic 
	Resolves MAC address using ARP and appends to frame. 
	MAC address determines the destination of delivery. 
Network Interface Card (NIC) connects computers to networks
	MAC address unique to each NIC
	Data transmission (1.Bits to frames && 2.Packets to frames)
		1.Bits organized into frames and frames used to process(create) packets 
		2.Headers(e.g., MAC) and trailers and converts into frames for physical layer
	Error detection + correction 
		Checksum to check for errors
		If error, request packet again 
		or try to correct it
	Buffering (Flow Control)
		Stores incoming/outgoing data temporarily
		So device isn't overwhelmed with packets
