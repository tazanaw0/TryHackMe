Developed by the ISO, the OSI model describes how communication should occur in any computer network. 

Probably 
	(1) Physical
	Data transmitted over electrical, optical or wireless signals. 
Didn't
	(2) Data link
	Data transfer between nodes on the same network using MAC addresses (6 bytes, first 3 = vender, last 3 = unique id)
	![Wireshark interface displaying a packet with the source and destination MAC addresses highlighted.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719848893497.png)
	Yellow = destination MAC address 
	Blue = Source MAC address
	remainder = payload 
Need 
	(3) Network 
	Data transfer between devices on different networks 
	Addressing and routing
Those 
	(4) Transport
	Connection oriented (TCP)
		Flow control (rwnd, cwnd), segmentation, and error correction 
	Connectionless (UDP)
		No mechanisms for quality control
		Keep alive packets
		STUN, TURN, ICE
Stupid 
	(5) Session
		Establishing, maintaining, and synchronizing comms
		+ recovery 
	
Packets 
	(6) Presentation
		Compression, encoding, and encryption. 
Anyways 
	(7) Application 
		How comms are presented to end users
		DNS, HTTP, FTP, SSH, etc.
