Both allow processes from different hosts to communicate with each other. 

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
	Connectionless 
		i.e., data sent without confirmation from receiver 
	Used when requiring speed over reliability. 
Port numbers used for sending/receiving data between apps
	0-65535 (2^16-1, 0 reserved) available ports

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
	Connection-oriented 
		i.e., receiver must acknowledge incoming request (three-way handshake)
	Each segment (data octet) has its own sequence number 
	SYN & ACK = two flags used in three-way handshake
	three-way process
		SYN Packet
			initiates connection
			+ contains clients random initial sequence number (seq=x)
		SYN-ACK Packet
			Server response (acknowledging they've received SYN) (seq = y ACK=x+1)
		ACK Packet
			Completes process, informs server (receiver) SYN-ACK was received. (ACK=y+1)
