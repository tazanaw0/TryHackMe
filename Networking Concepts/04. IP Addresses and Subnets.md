IPv4
	32 bit 
	4 octets w/ each representing a number from 0-255
	4 billion addresses 
IPv6
	128 bit 
	16 octets w/ each representing a hexadecimal number from 00-FFFF 
	insanely large amount of host addresses (2^128) 

0 often reserved for network address
255 reserved for broadcast address 
	packets sent to all hosts on the network.

'ip a s' in linux 
	displays network card details 

Private IP address ranges (RFC 1918)
	- `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (`10/8`)
	- `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (`172.16/12`)
	- `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (`192.168/16`)

Routing 
	Routers similar to USPS
	packets sent (dropped off at) to postal office, then USPS is responsible for delivery(determine route,etc.)
	Packets communicate with many routers en route to its destination (similar to a package traveling between many facilities)
![A computer network diagram showing a web server, a mobile user with a laptop, and an office user with a desktop computer. There are six routers between the three systems and there are different paths that a packet can use to travel from one system to the other.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476-1719848991082.svg)
