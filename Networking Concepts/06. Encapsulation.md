The process in which data is appended (as headers and sometimes trailers) to PDUs (frames, packet, segment) to help subsequent layers with processing.

	![What is the Ethernet Frame Format?](https://images.ctfassets.net/aoyx73g9h2pg/2hlgaNaAHlo7bFDA1RZ6dx/f56d6641067918a7258114f06feb5c9a/What-is-Ethernet-Frame-Format-Diagram.jpg)
		preamble synchronize receiving device's clock so the receiver understand what's coming. 
			w/o receiver cannot understand and frame fails
		SOF = Start of Frame delimiter (SFD)
			specific bit sequence (10101011) which marks end of preamble + indicates start of frame (payload)
		EtherType/Length
			Specifies size of payload and type of  protocol (ipv4,ipv6, arp)
		Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
			error checking, if frame corrupted, FCS on the frame will not match receivers calculated FCS
E.g. Here's what occurs when a user queries Amazon.com
	User enters query into a browser
	Browser prepares HTTP request, fwds it to transport layer 
	Browser and web server complete three-way handshake to establish connection
	Browser sends HTTP request with users query
		Segments forwarded to internet layer
	Network layer encapsulates each segment with packet headers specifying source, destination ip address, etc. and sends below to link layer 
	Link Layer encapsulates packets depending on protocol (ethernet or wifi (802.11)) with frame header and sends to router
		Ensures packets travel over medium used to access internet. 
	Router removes link layer header and trailer, and routes packet to next link using its routing table and the packets ip header. 
		packet is re-encapsulated with frame header/trailer before sent
		If the router doesn't have the next hop's (router) mac address, it'll send an arp request. 
When the packets arrive, the recipients machine does this process in reverse until all the data is extracted and presented at the application layer.
