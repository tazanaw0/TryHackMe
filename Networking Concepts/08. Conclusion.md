In this room, we read about the OSI and TCP/IP model, IP addressing, subnetting, routing, encapsulation, and telnet. The OSI and TCP/IP model defines how communication occurs across local area and wide area networks. TCP/IP is used everywhere whereas the OSI is often referenced for understanding different components of network communications. Then, we delve into IP addressing, routing and subnets. I realized we can memorize private IP ranges by their cidr notation (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16). We also read about the encapsulation process that occurs at layers 2,3, and 4. Each layer adds/removes information to help other layers in extracting the payload. When communicating via the internet, every node en route to a destination performs the encapsulation/decapsulation process. Without this process, each node (routers) wont know where to forward incoming packets. 
Lastly, we worked with telnet to connect to a remote server and accessed a few different running services.
